# Future: Containerization & Cloud Hosting

**Status**: Future (After MVP)  
**Purpose**: Easy deployment and managed service options

---

## Phase 1: Containerization (Before Cloud)

**When**: After MVP is working and tested  
**Time**: 2-3 hours  
**Goal**: Make self-hosting dead simple

### Why Containerize First?

1. **Validate MVP** - Ensure app works before investing in cloud infrastructure
2. **Easy Self-Hosting** - One-command deployment for technical users
3. **Cloud-Ready** - Same container works everywhere
4. **Community Testing** - Let users deploy and provide feedback

### Docker Setup

**Create**: `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-slim

# Install FFmpeg
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./

# Install pnpm and dependencies
RUN npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy app files
COPY . .

# Build Next.js app
RUN pnpm build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
```

**Create**: `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    volumes:
      - /tmp:/tmp  # For temp files
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Create**: `.dockerignore`

```
node_modules
.next
.git
.env*.local
README.md
```

### Usage

```bash
# Self-hosting with Docker
git clone https://github.com/you/ai-generated-captions.git
cd ai-generated-captions
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." > .env.local
docker-compose up -d

# App runs on http://localhost:3000
```

### Deployment Platforms

Once containerized, users can deploy to:
- **Vercel** (easiest for Next.js)
- **Railway** (good for Docker)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- **Fly.io**
- **Google Cloud Run**
- **AWS ECS/Fargate**

---

## Phase 2: Cloud Hosted Service (Separate Project)

**When**: After containerized version validated  
**Time**: 40-60 hours (full project)  
**Goal**: Managed SaaS for non-technical users

### Why Cloud Hosted?

**Self-Hosted (BYOM)** is great for:
- Developers
- Technical users
- Privacy-conscious organizations
- Cost-conscious users

**Cloud Hosted** serves:
- Non-technical content creators
- Users who want "just works" experience
- Teams needing collaboration
- Users who value convenience over cost

```

### Cost Estimate (Cloud)

**Infrastructure** (per month):
- Hosting: $10-20 (Vercel/Railway)
- Database: $10-25 (Supabase/Neon)
- Storage: $5-10 (R2/S3)
- Redis: $10 (Upstash)
- **Total**: ~$35-65/month base

**Per User Costs**:
- Whisper API: $0.006/min
- Storage: $0.01/GB/month
- Bandwidth: $0.05/GB

**Margins**:
- Charge $9 for 300 mins = ~$1.80 API cost = 80% margin
- Charge $29 for 1000 mins = ~$6 API cost = 79% margin

**Break-even**: ~20-30 paying users

## Decision Points

### When to Containerize?
**Trigger**: MVP works well, 5+ GitHub stars, 2+ external users request easy deployment

### When to Build Cloud Version?
**Triggers**:
1. Self-hosted version has 100+ GitHub stars
2. 20+ users actively using it
3. Multiple requests for "I'd pay for hosted version"
4. Competitor research shows clear market gap
5. Have 40-60 hours to commit to project

### When NOT to Build Cloud?
**Red Flags**:
- Few users interested in self-hosted
- Negative feedback on core functionality
- High churn in early users
- Competitor launches similar product
- Can't commit to ongoing support

---

## Key Differences

### Self-Hosted (BYOM)
- ✅ Free and open-source
- ✅ Complete control
- ✅ Your API keys
- ✅ Your infrastructure
- ❌ Technical setup required
- ❌ No collaboration features
- ❌ No video storage

### Cloud Hosted
- ✅ "Just works" experience
- ✅ No technical setup
- ✅ Video storage and history
- ✅ Team collaboration
- ✅ Premium support
- ❌ Monthly subscription
- ❌ Less control
- ❌ Videos on our servers

**Both versions share**:
- Same core transcription quality
- Same output formats
- Same open-source codebase
- Same AI models

---

## Questions to Answer First

Before building cloud version:

1. **Is there demand?**
   - How many self-hosted users are active?
   - How many say "I'd pay for hosted"?

2. **Can we compete?**
   - What's Maestra's retention rate?
   - Can we offer 50% discount and still profit?

3. **Do we have resources?**
   - Can we commit to customer support?
   - Do we have capital for infrastructure?

4. **Is timing right?**
   - Is self-hosted version stable?
   - Do we understand user needs?

---

## Summary

1. **Now**: Build MVP (self-hosted BYOM)
2. **Next**: Containerize for easy deployment
3. **Then**: Gather feedback and validate market
4. **Later**: Build cloud hosted if demand exists

**Philosophy**: Prove value with free/self-hosted first, then monetize convenience.

This approach minimizes risk and maximizes learning.
