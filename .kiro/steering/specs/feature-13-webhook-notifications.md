**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours  
**Git Commit Scope**: Single atomic commit

## Overview
Add webhook notification system to notify external services when caption generation completes, enabling workflow automation and integrations.

## Objectives
- Allow users to register webhook URLs
- Send notifications on job completion
- Include job results in webhook payload
- Retry failed webhook deliveries
- Provide webhook delivery logs

## Tasks

### 1. Create Webhook Management UI
- Add webhook settings in user/project settings
- Allow multiple webhook URLs per user
- Add URL validation and testing
- Support webhook enable/disable toggle

### 2. Implement Webhook Delivery System
- Create `src/lib/webhook-sender.ts` utility
- Send POST request to webhook URL on job completion
- Include job ID, status, and download links in payload
- Add signature header for security (HMAC)

### 3. Add Retry Logic
- Retry failed webhooks up to 3 times
- Use exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min)
- Mark webhook as failed after max retries
- Send notification email on repeated failures

### 4. Create Webhook Logs
- Log all webhook attempts (success/failure)
- Show delivery history in settings
- Include response status and timing
- Add filtering and search capabilities

### 5. Add Security Features
- Generate webhook secret for each URL
- Include HMAC signature in headers
- Validate webhook URLs before saving
- Add IP whitelist option for webhooks

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Webhooks triggered on job completion
- ✅ Payload includes all necessary data
- ✅ Failed webhooks retry automatically
- ✅ Webhook logs accessible and useful
- ✅ Security headers validated by test servers

## Technical Notes
- Payload format: JSON with job metadata
- Signature: HMAC-SHA256 of payload
- Timeout per webhook: 10 seconds
- Max payload size: 10MB

## Dependencies
- Feature 12: REST API for Programmatic Access (shares job system)

## Follows Features
- None (final feature in current roadmap)
