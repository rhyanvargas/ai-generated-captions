## Product Overview

A Next.js web application that automatically generates video captions using AI transcription. The app emphasizes simplicity, self-hosting, and user control through the BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) philosophy.

### Key Differentiators
1. **BYOM Philosophy** - Users provide their own API keys
2. **Self-Hosted** - Run on your own infrastructure
3. **Open-Source** - Fully transparent, customizable codebase
4. **Pay-Per-Use** - No subscriptions, only pay for API usage
5. **Minimal Code** - Clean, focused implementation

## BYOM (Bring Your Own Model) Philosophy

### Core Principles

**User Control**:
- Users provide their own OpenAI API keys via `.env.local`
- No middleman charges or markup
- Complete cost transparency
- Data never touches our servers (self-hosted)

**Cost Structure**:
- **OpenAI Whisper API**: ~$0.006 per minute of audio
- **Example**: 10 hours of video = ~$3.60 in API costs
- **No subscription fees**
- **No hidden charges**

**Comparison to Competitors**:
| Feature | Our Tool (BYOM) | Maestra.ai | Rev.com |
|---------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **Pricing** | $0.006/min (API only) | $12-120/month | $1.50/min |
| **Data Privacy** | Your infrastructure | Their servers | Their servers |
| **Customization** | Full control | Limited | None |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | None | High | High |

**Savings**: 90% cheaper than SaaS alternatives for regular usage.
