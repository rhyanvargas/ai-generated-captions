## 🧪 Vitest Testing Framework Setup
**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Category**: Testing Infrastructure

### Problem
No testing framework configured in the project. Need to implement mandatory testing requirements for all features while following Next.js official best practices.

### Solution
- Installed official Next.js recommended packages: `vitest`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `jsdom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/dom`, `vite-tsconfig-paths`
- Created `vitest.config.mts` (using `.mts` extension for ES modules compatibility)
- Added `tsconfigPaths()` plugin to resolve `@/*` imports
- Configured `globals: true` to avoid importing `describe`, `it`, `expect` in every test
- Set `environment: 'jsdom'` for React component testing
- Added `"types": ["vitest/globals"]` to `tsconfig.json`
- Created example test `src/app/__tests__/page.test.tsx`

### Key Takeaways
- **Official Documentation**: Following Next.js and Vitest docs ensures compatibility
- **`.mts` Extension**: Required for ES module projects to avoid `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` errors
- **Global APIs**: `globals: true` improves developer experience (no imports needed)
- **Path Resolution**: `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin essential for `@/*` imports
- **Mandatory Testing**: All features now require ≥80% test coverage before completion

### Code Example
```typescript
// vitest.config.mts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tsconfigPaths(), // Resolves @/* imports
    react(),
  ],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    globals: true,
    setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'],
  },
})

// Example test - no imports needed with globals: true
describe('Home Page', () => {
  it('should render the heading', () => {
    render(<Page />)
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })).toBeDefined()
  })
})
```

## 🎯 Mock Transcription System Implementation
**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Category**: Architecture

### Problem
API route attempted to call OpenAI's `generateText()` without an API key, causing errors. App was unusable without OpenAI credentials, creating a barrier to entry for testing and development.

### Solution
- Removed direct OpenAI SDK calls from API route
- Created `generateMockTranscript()` function with realistic demo captions
- Implemented environment-based fallback: real transcription if API key present, mock otherwise
- Added clear console logs (`[MOCK MODE]`) for transparency
- Maintained same response structure for seamless integration

### Key Takeaways
- **Zero Friction**: App works immediately without any setup or API keys
- **Development Speed**: Mock mode enables UI/UX development without API costs
- **Gradual Implementation**: Can add real transcription later without breaking changes
- **User Experience**: Clear indicators show when mock mode is active
- **Cost Control**: No accidental API charges during development

### Code Example
```typescript
// Before: Direct OpenAI call (required API key)
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: `Transcribe: ${videoUrl}`,
})

// After: Mock with fallback strategy
function generateMockTranscript(inputType: string, identifier: string): string {
  const captions = [
    "Welcome to this tutorial on AI-powered video captions.",
    "Today we'll explore how to automatically generate captions.",
    // ... more realistic content
  ]
  return captions.join('\n\n')
}

// In API route
const hasApiKey = !!process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
if (hasApiKey) {
  // Real transcription (future)
} else {
  console.log('🎭 [MOCK MODE] Generating mock transcript')
  transcriptText = generateMockTranscript(inputType, videoIdentifier)
}
```

## 💡 BYOM Philosophy & Core Messaging
**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Category**: Product Strategy

### Problem
Unclear value proposition and positioning. Original messaging didn't differentiate from competitors or communicate the self-hosted, cost-effective nature of the tool.

### Solution
- Defined core message: "The Simple, Open-Source Caption Generator for Developers and Creators. Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)"
- Updated all UI components with BYOM messaging
- Emphasized cost savings: ~$0.006/min vs. competitors' $12-120/month subscriptions
- Positioned as self-hosted alternative to SaaS solutions
- Created competitive analysis document (vs. Maestra.ai)

### Key Takeaways
- **Clear Positioning**: BYOM concept distinguishes from SaaS competitors
- **Cost Transparency**: Users pay only for API usage with their own keys
- **Privacy Control**: Self-hosted = complete data control
- **Target Audience**: Developers and technical users who value control
- **Competitive Advantage**: 90% cheaper than enterprise solutions

### Code Example
```tsx
// Before: Generic messaging
<p>Upload your video and get automatically generated captions</p>

// After: BYOM-focused messaging
<p>
  "The Simple, Open-Source Caption Generator for Developers and Creators. 
  <br /> Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)"
</p>

// Metadata
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  description: "The Simple, Affordable, Open-Source Caption Generator for Developers and Creators. Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)..."
}
```

## 🔄 AI SDK v5 Integration in Feature Specs
**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Category**: Architecture

### Problem
Feature 02 (Whisper API Integration) originally used outdated OpenAI SDK patterns. Needed to align with AI SDK v5's `experimental_transcribe` function for modern, type-safe transcription.

### Solution
- Updated Feature 02 spec to use AI SDK v5 `experimental_transcribe`
- Replaced custom API client code with one-liner AI SDK calls
- Added proper `timestampGranularities: ['segment']` for VTT formatting
- Included language hints for improved accuracy
- Reduced implementation time from 2-3 hours to 1-2 hours
- Added complete code examples with AI SDK v5 syntax

### Key Takeaways
- **Modern Standards**: AI SDK provides unified interface across providers
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper types
- **Simplicity**: One function call vs. complex API client setup
- **Timestamps**: Segment granularity provides VTT-ready timing data
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap providers (OpenAI, Groq, etc.)

### Code Example
```typescript
// Before: Custom OpenAI client setup
import OpenAI from 'openai'
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY })
const result = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
  file: audioFile,
  model: 'whisper-1',
  response_format: 'verbose_json',
})

// After: AI SDK v5
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'

const result = await transcribe({
  model: openai.transcription('whisper-1'),
  audio: audioBuffer,
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      timestampGranularities: ['segment'],
      language: 'en', // Optional hint
    }
  }
})

// Access results directly
result.text       // Full transcript
result.segments   // Array with startSecond/endSecond
result.language   // Detected language
```
